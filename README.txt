========== No Synchronization vs. Synchronized ==========
Without synchronization, the threads appear to return random numbers. In truth, they are not random, but they are also not predictable. The threads run right after they are created, per the program's instructions, and then wait for 100ms. When the 100ms timer ends, the thread then reads the sum variable, updates it, and commits the update to memory. This process can be interrupted by another thread if it is not synchronized or locked in some way. If another thread alters a shared variable while another thread is trying to update, conflicts can occur. Once the read-write operations are synchronized, the sum output is more predictable.

========== Block Synchronization vs. Method Synchronization ==========
In method synchronization, everything that happens in the method is synchronized. Since the method can contain lines of code that are not related to reading, updating, or recording data, the other threads have to wait until the first thread is complete. With block synchronization, you can have greater control over what lines are synchronized. In this machine problem, you can allow all threads to run the 100ms sleep method at the same time, and then read and write one at a time. This allows the program to reach completion much quicker.
